    <p>Guideline 1.1 explains that there should be text alternatives to any non-text content that serves an equivalent purpose, with the exception of controls or inputs, time-based media, tests, specific sensory experiences, CAPTCHA, Decorations, formatting, or if it is meant to be invisible.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Guideline 1.2 explains how there should be an alternative for various types of media, such as audio-only, video-only, or time-based media, 1.2 also goes over how there should be extended audio descriptions for when pauses in foreground audio cannot fully convey the sense of the video. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Guideline 1.3 explains how content needs to be more robust, it informs us to not rely solely on any single sensory characteristics, and how things need to be programmatically determined and understandable in that state. It also explains that content should not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, unless a specific display orientation is essential, such as a bank check, a piano application, slides for a projector or television or virtual reality content.</p>

    <p>Guideline 1.4 explains a variety of guidelines that help see and hear content instead of it blending in with the background or foreground, such as using color, allowing control within the website to pause or stop audio that plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, how contrast at a minimum must have a contrast ration of at least 4.5:1 with the exception of large text, incidental text or images that are pure decoration or are not visible to anyone, or logotypes. Resizable text, up to 200% without loss of content or functionality, with the exclusion of captions and images of text. Text is used to conbey informaiton rather than images of text except for when the image of text can be cusomized to the user's requirements, or the presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed. Enhanced contrast should have the visual presentaiton of text and images of text to a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, with the exception of large text which should instead have a 4.5:1 ratio, incidental text or images of text that are pure decoration, not visible to anyone, and Logotypes,both have no contrast requirement. For prerecorded audio content that contains primarily speech in the foreground, is not an audio CAPTCHA, music, or an audio logo, there needs to be either, no background, the ability to turn the background sounds off, or the background sounds are at least 20 dB lower than the foreground speech content, Visually, foreground and background colors can be changed by the user, the width is no more than 80 characters, the text is not justified.images of text are only used for pure decoration or where it is essential to the information being conveyed. Content should be presented without the loss of information or functionality, The visual presentation of user interface components, and graphical objects have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against touching colors. Hidden content that can be triggered by hovering the pointer over or keyboard focus triggers then becomes visible must be dismissible, or if it is triggered by hovering over, then it should be dismissible by moving the cursor elsewhere.</p>
