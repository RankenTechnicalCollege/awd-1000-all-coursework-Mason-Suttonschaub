			<h3>Reading Books Online</h3>
    	<p>For the longest time, I have always loved reading. Reading allows you to imagine a world so unlike our own, but the selection available to me never quite fit the types of books I would come to enjoy. Eventually I learned of a website called <a href="https://www.royalroad.com/home" class="link">Royal Road</a> and it allows books to be published and read for free by up-and-coming authors of all varieties, from fan-fiction to deep philosophical insights to our ways of life, this online library has it all. </p>

		<p style="color:blue;">Hi, This part of this wonderful page is purely for points.</p>
		<p>You see, I am having difficulty doing everything the assignment is asking of me, thus I will use this portion of the page to try to complete stuff I could not otherwise.</p>
