    <p>For the longest time, I have always loved reading. Reading allows you to imagine a world so unlike our own, but the selection available to me never quite fit the types of books I would come to enjoy. Eventually I learned of websites that allow books to be published and read for free by up-and-coming authors of all varieties, from fan-fiction to deep philosophical insights to our ways of life, these online libraries had it all. </p>
